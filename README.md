# Test-Time Curricula for Targeted RL

Implementation of the method and experiments for the "[Learning on the Job: Test-Time Curricula for Target RL]()" paper.

## ðŸš€ Installation & Setup
This library builds on the [Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (TTRL)](https://github.com/PRIME-RL/TTRL) and the [Volcano Engine Reinforcement Learning (verl)](https://github.com/volcengine/verl) libraries. Please refer to the documentation of these libraries for basic functionality and setup.

Clone the repository and add to PYTHONPATH:
```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/jonhue/ttc
PYTHONPATH=...
```
Install additional libraries and the modified version of verl:
```
pip install word2number latex2sympy2 math-verify[antlr4_13_2]==0.8.0;
pip install -e ${PYTHONPATH}TTRL/verl/.; 
pip install -e ${PYTHONPATH}activeft/.; 
```

## ðŸ“š Corpus Creation

To generate the corpus, run:
```
python $PYTHON_PATH/data/train/create_dataset.py
```

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Preprocessing

Use the generate_verl_data.sh script to create datasets for training.
```
DATA_PATH=...
bash ${PYTHONPATH}generate_verl_data.sh Qwen/Qwen3-8B lasgroup/verifiable-corpus math-ai/aime25 $DATA_PATH false 500000 true false false true 
```


## ðŸŽ¯ Training
To start TTC-RL training on the generated dataset:
```
bash ${PYTHONPATH}training/verl_training.sh Qwen/Qwen3-8B lasgroup_verifiable-corpus_math-ai_aime25_500000 True False test grpo vtl False False 10 1000 1000
```
